## Strategy

1. Looked through data set to find meaningful (to me) relationships
2. Chose technologies to visualize said relationships

_why did I choose this method_

## Points of Interest

1. Enjoyed using new technologies (never used any of them before)
2. Working with real-world data and identifying problems (and solutions)

## Improvements and Extensions

1. Facebook locations don't identify every grocery store/farmer's market (pull city building permit/business license data)
2. The provided data set B19051 outlines number of homes with income in a census tract, B10952 (which outlines income) would be better suited for this comparison
3. Mixing of county-level and city-level data, in the future I would prefer to use data with the same sample area
4. Use the visualized data to identify locations where new healthy food sources are sorely needed (and therefore could be located). Could pull vacant parcel data to identify possible locations for new food sources.
